# Wordle Engine
Instantly (or not) solve most 5-word puzzles.

## Cheating
For a nearly instant answer, use `cheat`:
```
npm run cheat
```

This works because the creator has a word 'cycle', after an `x` amount of days, the words repeat, and its not hard to get the current cycle.

## 'Legit'
This is a more legitimate method, using only guesses and inferences.
```
npm run legit
```

You will need to have user input.
